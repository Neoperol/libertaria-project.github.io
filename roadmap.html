      <p>The Libertaria Initiative is starting a vast amount of projects to reach its goals. Due to the complexity and dependencies of the projects, we have to do it in a specific order:
      </p>
      <p>Technical fundament, distribution of nodes, federated network, community, communication
Economy, blockchain, transactions
Law, production
ID & Reputation, Governance, liquid democracy
      </p>
    <p>Each project has many phases. After Phase 1 we need to have finished the specifications and a prototype to be able to complete a crowdfunding and to start a new project and move on to the next phase. Phase 1 means always firing up the various rockets to reach working Prototypes (regtest / testnet).
